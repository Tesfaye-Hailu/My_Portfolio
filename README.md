Project Title : Personal Portfolio Website
About the project: The project is a showcase platform to demonstrate our knowledge
Motivation: In fact, this is just a starting!  I’m motivated to do this project to show my projects online for any interested person and share some valuable blogs or new developments in the industry in the blog page. As mentioned earlier, this is just a beginning and it will be refined and more polished. 

Summary of the project : This is just a website to deploy my future applications to show to recruiters and broaden my knowledge.
The application has the following component: 
1.	Home     2. Portfolio       3. About     4.Contact      5.CV     6.Blogs
The Home & About page:  Shows something about me & it has a LinkedIn  link to connect with my LinkedIn account.
The Portfolio page: Shows the list of my projects done while I was at PerScholas and will keep on creating more advanced applications as I will broaden my knowledge by reading and dedicating more time for practice. When the image of the projects are clicked, it will direct to the actual projects.
The Contact  page –  will display my contact addresses.
The CV page  displays my CV in PDF format.
The Blogs page is empty for the time being,  but definitely I will put some blogs when I’m mastering the course and get time.
